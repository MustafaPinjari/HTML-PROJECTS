# 🎮 Simple XO Game

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Simple XO Game** project! This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as XO Game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of this project is to create a fun, interactive, and responsive game that allows two players to compete against each other on the same device.

## Features

- 🎮 **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can click on the game board to make their moves.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Turn Indication:** The game alternates between players "❌" and "⭕".
- 🏆 **Win Detection:** The game detects winning combinations and highlights the winning line.
- 🤝 **Draw Detection:** The game identifies a draw situation when all cells are filled without a winner.
- 🔄 **Restart Option:** Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the restart button.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their marks (❌ or ⭕) in an empty cell.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Game:** Launch the game in your web browser.
2. **Make a Move:** Click on any empty cell to place your mark (❌ or ⭕).
3. **Alternate Turns:** The game will automatically switch turns between players.
4. **Check for Winner:** The game will highlight the winning line if a player wins, or display a draw message if the game ends in a draw.
5. **Restart the Game:** Click the restart button to play again.
