# Snake Game Project üêçüéÆ

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a simple yet exciting implementation of the classic snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game speeds up as you progress, making it more challenging. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Adjustable Speed**: You can set the speed of the snake from 1 (slowest) to 9 (fastest).
- **Dynamic Food**: Random fruits appear on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score based on the speed and the number of fruits eaten.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.

## How to Play

1. **Set the Speed**: Use the input field to set the game speed.
2. **Start the Game**: Click the "start" button to begin.
3. **Control the Snake**: Use the arrow keys to move the snake in different directions (up, down, left, right).
4. **Eat the Food**: Guide the snake to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen to grow longer.
5. **Avoid Collisions**: Do not let the snake run into the walls or its own body, or the game will be over.
6. **Achieve High Score**: Try to score as high as possible by eating more food and avoiding collisions.
