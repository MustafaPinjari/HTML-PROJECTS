## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

You need a web browser to view the project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo from GitHub.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the project.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic and animation of the bouncing balls.
- `favicon/`: A directory containing the favicon for the webpage.

## Usage

When you open `index.html` in a browser, you'll see a full-screen canvas with animated balls bouncing around. The balls change color upon colliding with each other and bounce off the edges of the canvas.

### How It Works

- **HTML**: Sets up the basic structure, including the canvas element where the balls will be drawn.
- **CSS**: Provides basic styling for the webpage, ensuring the canvas takes up the full screen and the page has no margins or overflow.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the creation, drawing, updating, and collision detection of the balls.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the project:

### Number of Balls

To change the number of balls, modify the condition in the `while` loop in `main.js`.

### Ball Size

The size of the balls is determined randomly within a range. To change this range, modify the respective lines in `main.js`.

### Ball Speed

The speed of the balls is also randomly determined. To change the speed range, modify the respective lines in `main.js`.

### Ball Colors

Ball colors are randomly generated using RGB values. You can customize how colors are assigned by modifying the random function calls in `main.js`.
