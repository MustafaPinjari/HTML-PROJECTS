# Bouncing Balls Project

Welcome to the **Bouncing Balls** project! This project demonstrates the creation of animated bouncing balls using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Each ball changes color upon collision with another ball or with the edges of the canvas.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes HTML5 Canvas to create a simple animation of bouncing balls. Each ball has its own properties such as position, velocity, color, and size. When the balls collide with each other or the edges of the canvas, they change direction and color, creating a visually engaging effect.

## Files Included

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the canvas element and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for basic styling of the HTML elements.
- **main.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for creating and animating the bouncing balls.

## Setup and Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MustafaPinjari/bouncing-balls.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd bouncing-balls
    ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

Alternatively, you can simply double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add interactivity to allow users to add or remove balls by clicking or using buttons.
- Implement different shapes and sizes for variety.
- Improve collision physics to make the animation more realistic.
- Add a UI for adjusting parameters like ball speed, number of balls, and colors.
